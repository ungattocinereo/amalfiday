Sunrise, Plans, and Precision

Small Town. Major Memories.

Lashanda Brown arrived in Atrani for a birthday trip built around a very tight schedule. She booked the photoshoot through GetYourGuide as a birthday gift to herself during one of the busiest periods of her year.

The session took place on August 18. I always prefer starting as early as possible — especially in August on the Amalfi Coast. At that time of year, sunrise comes very early, and by around 06:15 the light is already strong enough to work with. I was already at the bus stop when they arrived.

August traffic on the coast is constant, so their car was slightly delayed, but they still reached the location almost exactly on schedule. Lashanda arrived together with her sister, who organized the photoshoot as a gift and also helped as an improvised stylist and prop assistant during the session.

A City That Becomes a Set

Energy Writes The Story.

We started at one of my favorite places — the Atrani bus stop. It is often considered one of the most beautiful bus stops in the world because of the backdrop: sea, cliffs, pastel houses, and open sky in one frame.

At the same time, the town was decorated for the Blue Fish Festival, which turned every corner of Atrani into a natural set. We styled the birthday girl with a golden ribbon and crown and started shooting immediately.

The key goal was simple: work fast, work before the heat becomes extreme, and use the early morning softness that makes summer photos on the coast look alive instead of overheated.

When Plans Change Because of Beauty

Moments Over Timelines.

After moving through the narrow streets, we reached Piazza Santa Maria Maddalena, where we captured some of the strongest images of the session.

The planned one-hour session naturally extended — the atmosphere, decorations, light, and energy made it impossible to rush. Meanwhile, their taxi driver was already calling because their entire day was scheduled minute by minute.

In the end, the experience and the atmosphere of Atrani impressed them so much that they postponed their next activity — a cooking masterclass planned later that day on the coast.

The final photos came out vivid and memorable. These images will stay as a visual memory of a unique birthday in Italy — a day where time slowed down just enough to make space for real moments.
