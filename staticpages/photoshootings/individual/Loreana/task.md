Block 1 — Discovering the Amalfi Coast for the First Time

Loreana was in Rome with her friends, visiting Italy for a short trip from Peru. For her, Italy had always meant the classic triangle: Rome, Milan, Venice. The Amalfi Coast was something she had never heard much about and had never visited before.

While they were in Rome, her friends told her about the Amalfi Coast — dramatic cliffs, colorful towns, sea views, and small hidden streets. The idea surprised her. It immediately became something she wanted to experience during that same trip.

Even though her schedule was tight, she decided to travel alone for a couple of days in the middle of the season. On September 7, 2025, a Sunday morning, she contacted me through GetYourGuide and asked if a photoshoot could be arranged within a few hours.

She wanted to capture a place that felt unique, beautiful, and real — not just a location, but a memory she could keep forever.

Block 2 — From Salerno to Amalfi, Then a Better Idea

At that moment I was in Salerno, but I still managed to reach Amalfi by the afternoon, right when the golden hour was starting. After a short conversation, it was clear that we connected very naturally — something that often happens during personal photoshoots.

Amalfi on that date was extremely crowded. Streets were full, viewpoints were busy, and it was difficult to find quiet spaces for natural photography. I suggested moving the session to Ravello — one of my favorite locations on the coast. Ravello offers softer colors, more space, and a calmer atmosphere, especially during high season.

We quickly decided to move. We jumped on my bike and reached Ravello as fast as possible.

The decision was correct. The light was warm, the colors were deep, and the atmosphere was relaxed. We walked, talked, laughed, took photos, and even stopped for an Aperol. The session felt natural and effortless.

Block 3 — When a Photoshoot Becomes a Birthday Gift to Yourself

What started as a spontaneous message became one of the most meaningful moments of her trip.

Travel memories fade. Photos stay. But when a photoshoot is personal, spontaneous, and connected to a real story, it becomes something else — a personal milestone.

More and more people choose travel photoshoots as gifts to themselves: birthdays, life changes, solo trips, or simply moments when they want to celebrate where they are in life.

For Loreana, this photoshoot became exactly that — a birthday gift to herself, created without planning, without stress, just by following a feeling.
